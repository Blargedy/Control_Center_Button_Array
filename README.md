# Control_Center_Button_Array

When controlling a Voron printer with those LCD screens with the single knob you can turn and press, or even a touchscreen running KlipperScreen, many of the controls you need are necessarily behind several layers of menus you need to navigate. This mod replaces the front two skirts and display/screen section of a V2.4 or Trident with an array of buttons, knobs, joystick, switches, and indicators. This lets you isntantly access many functions that would normally require navigation through the interface.
